This module provides a level of integration between dotProject
and the Eventum helpdesk system from MySQL.

Install the dotproject module as normal, by copying all of
the contents of this directory into a directory called eventum
in the dotproject modules directory then use the system admin
View Modules menu to install.

Once installed you will need to configure it.  This is done
by using the configure option in View Modules.  This asks
for the Eventum directory and will ask you to download
an archive to be uploaded into the eventum directory.

This archive, along with the configuration file the configure
option will write or display, provides the integration
backend so that Eventum can make use of the dotProject
companies and contacts.

If dotProject cannot write out it's configuration file it
will display the contents for you to cut and paste into
the dp_config.php file in the Eventum installation directory.

Once you have installed the eventum integration module you
will need to log out of dotproject and back in again. This
should load an Issues tab in the Today view and in the
projects view page.

More information can be found on the dotproject documentation
site:  docs.dotproject.net.
